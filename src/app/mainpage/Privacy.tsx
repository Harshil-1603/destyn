              1. Where This Privacy Policy Applies
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the brand. Whether you're searching for your soulmate, joining us at one of our events, or using any of our other awesome services, this Policy has got you covered. For simplicity, we just refer to all of these as our "service" in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "12px" }}>
              If for some reason, one of our services requires its own separate privacy policy, then that policy will be made available to you and that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- will apply.

              2. Data We Collect
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              It goes without saying, we can't help you develop meaningful connections without you providing some information about yourself, like basic profile details and the types of people you'd like to meet. Using our service also generates some information, such as when you logged in and how you used the service. We may also collect data from third parties, like when you access the service through an account you have on another platform (e.g., Facebook, Google, or Apple) or when you upload information from your account on another platform to complete your profile. If you're interested in all the details, be sure to check out the table below.

              </h2>
              
              <p>
                We want the connections you make through our service to last forever, but we keep your personal data only as long as necessary for legitimate business reasons (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law.
              </p>

              <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
                If you decide to stop using our service, you can close your account, and your profile will no longer be visible to other members.
              </p>

              <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
                Following account closure, we delete your data as laid out below:
              </p>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  To protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure or up to two years following an account ban. During this period, we keep your data to investigate unlawful or harmful conduct. The retention of data during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.
                </li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  We maintain limited data on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as imprecise location of download/purchase for five years in support of our safety efforts, to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.
                </li>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  Finally, we maintain data based on our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep data, in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
                Where and as legally permitted, we may maintain and use data that, by itself, cannot identify or be attributed specifically to you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to improve our service and create new features, technologies, and services and keep Destyn services safe.
