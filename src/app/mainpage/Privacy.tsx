              1. Where This Privacy Policy Applies
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the brand. Whether you're searching for your soulmate, joining us at one of our events, or using any of our other awesome services, this Policy has got you covered. For simplicity, we just refer to all of these as our "service" in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "12px" }}>
              If for some reason, one of our services requires its own separate privacy policy, then that policy will be made available to you and that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- will apply.

              2. Data We Collect
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              It goes without saying, we can't help you develop meaningful connections without you providing some information about yourself, like basic profile details and the types of people you'd like to meet. Using our service also generates some information, such as when you logged in and how you used the service. We may also collect data from third parties, like when you access the service through an account you have on another platform (e.g., Facebook, Google, or Apple) or when you upload information from your account on another platform to complete your profile. If you're interested in all the details, be sure to check out the table below.
